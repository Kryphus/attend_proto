# ✅ O8 - Retry & Idempotency Hardening COMPLETE

## Summary

**Good news!** O8.1 and O8.2 were already implemented in previous phases. I've now added comprehensive tests for O8.3 to verify everything works correctly.

---

## 📦 What Was Already Implemented

### 1. **Jittered Exponential Backoff** (`lib/sync/backoff_calculator.dart`)
✅ Already complete from O3!

**Features:**
- Base delay: 30 seconds (configurable)
- Exponential growth: `baseDelay * 2^attempts`
- Capped at `FeatureFlags.maxRetryBackoff` (1 hour)
- Jitter: ±25% to prevent thundering herd
- Minimum delay: 1 second

**Formula:**
```
delay = min(maxRetryBackoff, baseDelay * 2^attempts) + jitter
where jitter = random(-25%, +25%)
```

**Example Progression:**
```
Attempt 0: ~30s  (30s * 2^0 ± 25%)
Attempt 1: ~60s  (30s * 2^1 ± 25%)
Attempt 2: ~120s (30s * 2^2 ± 25%)
Attempt 3: ~240s (30s * 2^3 ± 25%)
Attempt 4: ~480s (30s * 2^4 ± 25%)
Attempt 5+: 3600s (capped at 1 hour)
```

### 2. **Error Classification** (`lib/data/remote/api_client.dart`)
✅ Already complete from O4!

**Retryable Errors (5xx, Network):**
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout
- Network timeouts
- Connection failures
- Socket exceptions

**Non-Retryable Errors (4xx):**
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found

**Behavior:**
- Retryable → Item stays in outbox with backoff
- Non-retryable → Event marked REJECTED with reason

### 3. **Dedupe Key Enforcement** (`lib/data/local/outbox_repo.dart`)
✅ Already complete from O1!

**Dedupe Key Format:**
```
{session_id}_{device_id}_{event_type}_{timestamp_minute}
```

**Database Constraint:**
```sql
dedupe_key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
```

**Behavior:**
- Duplicate `dedupe_key` → `DuplicateDedupeKeyException` thrown
- No duplicate events sent to server
- Idempotent by design

## 🧪 What Was Added (O8.3 Tests)

### 1. **Error Handling Tests** (`test/sync/error_handling_test.dart`)

**Tests Added:**
- ✅ Network errors are retryable
- ✅ 5xx server errors are retryable
- ✅ 4xx client errors are NOT retryable
- ✅ Unknown errors default to retryable
- ✅ Retryable error flag is set correctly
- ✅ Non-retryable error flag is set correctly
- ✅ Success responses have isRetryable=false
- ✅ Duplicate flag works correctly
- ✅ Status codes (CONFIRMED/REJECTED) are recognized

**Coverage:**
- Error classification logic
- ApiResponse structure
- Duplicate detection
- Status handling

### 2. **Idempotency Tests** (`test/integration/idempotency_test.dart`)

**Tests Added:**
- ✅ Duplicate dedupe_key is rejected
- ✅ Different dedupe_keys are allowed
- ✅ Dedupe_key is unique per event type and timestamp
- ✅ Only ready items are dequeued
- ✅ Items are dequeued in chronological order
- ✅ Batch limit is respected
- ✅ Multiple events can have same type
- ✅ Events have unique IDs
- ✅ Attempt count increments correctly
- ✅ Last error is recorded
- ✅ Successful items are removed from outbox
- ✅ Removing outbox item doesn't affect event log

**Coverage:**
- Dedupe key uniqueness
- Outbox retry logic
- Event log independence
- Attempt tracking
- Cleanup on success

## 🔍 Manual Verification in Supabase

You can verify idempotency on the server side using the SQL you already ran in O4.4.

### **Test Duplicate Prevention**

Run this twice in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- First call - creates event
select public.validate_attendance(
  jsonb_build_object(
    'user_id', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    'device_id', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001',
    'session_id', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002',
    'event_type', 'ATTEND_IN',
    'timestamp', now(),
    'location', jsonb_build_object(
      'lat', 6.682057,
      'lng', 125.353906,
      'accuracy', 10.0
    ),
    'biometric_ok', true,
    'biometric_timestamp', now(),
    'dedupe_key', 'test_o8_idempotency_001',
    'client_event_id', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000099'
  )
);
```

**Expected Output (First Call):**
```json
{
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "reason": "Event validated successfully",
  "event_id": "<some-uuid>",
  "duplicate": false
}
```

**Expected Output (Second Call - Same dedupe_key):**
```json
{
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "reason": "Event already processed",
  "event_id": "<same-uuid>",
  "duplicate": true    ← Notice this is TRUE
}
```

### **Verify Only One Row Created**

```sql
select count(*) as row_count
from public.attendance_events
where dedupe_key = 'test_o8_idempotency_001';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
row_count: 1    ← Should be exactly 1, not 2
```

## 🛡️ How It All Works Together

### **Scenario 1: Network Error During Sync**

```
1. User signs in (offline)
   → Event saved to event_log (PENDING)
   → Item added to outbox (attempts=0, next_attempt=now)

2. Sync worker runs
   → Dequeues item from outbox
   → Attempts POST to /api/attendance/validate
   → Network timeout occurs

3. Error handling
   → ApiClient detects retryable error
   → Marks attempt (attempts=1, last_error="network timeout")
   → Calculates backoff: ~30s ± 25%
   → Schedules next_attempt_at = now + 30s

4. Next sync cycle (30s later)
   → Dequeues item again (next_attempt_at ≤ now)
   → Retries POST
   → Success!
   → Event marked CONFIRMED
   → Item removed from outbox
```

### **Scenario 2: Duplicate Event (Idempotency)**

```
1. User signs in
   → Event "event-123" saved
   → Outbox item created with dedupe_key="session_device_ATTEND_IN_1234567890"

2. First sync attempt
   → POST to server with dedupe_key
   → Server creates attendance_event row
   → Returns "duplicate": false

3. App crashes before removing outbox item

4. Second sync attempt (after restart)
   → Same outbox item still exists
   → POST to server with SAME dedupe_key
   → Server finds existing row (dedupe_key unique constraint)
   → Returns same event_id, "duplicate": true
   → No second row created! ✅

5. Cleanup
   → Item removed from outbox
   → Only ONE event exists on server
```

### **Scenario 3: Geofence Violation (Non-Retryable)**

```
1. User tries to sign in outside geofence
   → Local rules pass (or are lenient)
   → Event saved to event_log (PENDING)
   → Item added to outbox

2. Sync worker runs
   → POST to server
   → Server validates: GEOFENCE_VIOLATION
   → Returns "status": "REJECTED", "reason": "GEOFENCE_VIOLATION: ..."

3. Error handling
   → ApiClient recognizes non-retryable rejection
   → Updates event_log: status=REJECTED, server_reason=message
   → Removes item from outbox (no retry needed)
   → User sees "REJECTED" pill in UI
```
