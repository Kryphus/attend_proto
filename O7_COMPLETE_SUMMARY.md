# ✅ O7 - Observability Hooks COMPLETE

## Summary

O7 is fully implemented! You now have comprehensive metrics tracking and a developer debug screen.

---

## 📊 What Was Added

### 1. **MetricsService** (`lib/services/metrics_service.dart`)
- Lightweight counter system
- 30+ predefined metrics
- JSON export functionality
- Time-based metadata

### 2. **Dev Profile Screen** (`lib/screens/dev_profile_screen.dart`)
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Log dump to clipboard (last 100 logs)
- Metrics export to clipboard
- Manual sync trigger
- Reset counters
- Clear logs
- Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
- Organized by category:
  - 📥 Capture (sign-in, sign-out, heartbeat)
  - ✅ Rules (passes, violations)
  - 📤 Outbox (enqueued, synced, retries)
  - 🔄 Sync (attempts, success, failure)
  - 📊 Events (pending, confirmed, rejected)
  - 🌐 API (calls, errors, retryable)
  - 🔁 Reconcile (attempts, updates)

### 3. **Metrics Integration**
All services now track metrics:
- `AttendanceService`: capture success/failure, rules
- `HeartbeatService`: heartbeat counts
- `SyncWorker`: sync operations, batches
- `ApiClient`: API call success/failure
- `ReconcileService`: reconciliation stats

### 4. **Tests**
- `test/services/metrics_service_test.dart` (15+ tests)
- `test/services/logging_service_test.dart` (15+ tests)

flutter run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Launching lib\main.dart on <device> in debug mode...
✓ Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk.
Installing...
Flutter run key commands.
```

### **Run Tests**
```powershell
flutter test test/services/metrics_service_test.dart
flutter test test/services/logging_service_test.dart
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00:01 +15: All tests passed!
00:01 +15: All tests passed!
```

### **Run All Tests**

## 🔍 How to Use Dev Profile

1. **Open the app**
2. **Tap the purple developer icon** (top-right corner)
3. **Dev Profile screen opens** with:
   - Summary stats at top
   - Action buttons (Dump Logs, Export Metrics, etc.)
   - Metrics grouped by category

### **Actions Available:**

| Button | What It Does | Output |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Dump Logs** | Copies last 100 logs as JSON to clipboard | Shows "Last 100 logs copied!" |
| **Export Metrics** | Copies all metrics as JSON to clipboard | Shows "Metrics exported!" |
| **Trigger Sync** | Manually runs sync + reconciliation | Shows "Sync completed!" |
| **Reset Counters** | Resets all metrics to 0 (keeps logs) | Confirms with dialog |
| **Clear Logs** | Deletes all logs (keeps metrics) | Confirms with dialog |

### **Auto-Refresh:**
- Metrics update every 2 seconds automatically
- Pause/resume with ⏸️/▶️ button in top bar
- Manual refresh with 🔄 button

## 🧪 Testing the Metrics

1. **Check-in** → Watch:
   - `capture.sign_in` +1
   - `capture.success` +1
   - `rule.pass` +1
   - `outbox.enqueued` +1
   - `event.pending` +1

2. **Sync Now** → Watch:
   - `sync.attempt` +1
   - `outbox.dequeued` +1
   - `api.call_success` +1
   - `event.confirmed` +1 (if accepted)
   - `event.pending` -1

3. **Toggle Wi-Fi** → Watch:
   - `api.retryable_error` increases when offline

4. **Dump Logs** → Paste clipboard:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
     "metrics": [
       {
         "name": "capture.success",
         "value": 5,
         "last_updated": "..."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
